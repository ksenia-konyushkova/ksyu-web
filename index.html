<strong>I am Ksenia</strong>, a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://cvlab.epfl.ch/">CVLab</a> at <a href="http://epfl.ch/">EPFL</a>.
In my research I apply methods from machine learning (and in particular active learning) to challenging problems in computer vision.

          In  my free time I enjoy the pleasures of Switzerland:
          beautiful sceneries for <a href="/photography">photography</a> and high mountains for snowboarding and hiking.

      <div class="col-md-8 justified">
        <p>
I joined CVlab in 2014 and since then I have been working with Prof. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en">Pascal Fua</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.artorg.unibe.ch/research/otl/people/persons/dr_sznitman_raphael/index_eng.html">Raphael Sznitman</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Algorithms and Machine Learning from <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en">University of Helsinki</a>.
During that time, I also worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.hiit.fi/complex-systems-computation">CoSCo</a> group at <a href="https://www.hiit.fi/">HIIT</a>.
Before, I studied in Russia at the <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/">Higher School of Economics</a> in the Faculty of Business Informatics and Applied Mathematics.

        <p>
Currently I am working on active learning for different segmentation tasks. 
While the goal of machine learning in general is to find the best predictive model given some data, the goal of active learning is to <em>select</em> which data should be annotated in order to learn the model as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
In practice, this means that instead of asking humans to segment whole images, we adaptively select which parts should be labelled in priority. 
It helps to reach the same quality of segmentation as standard machine learning methods in a shorter time.
