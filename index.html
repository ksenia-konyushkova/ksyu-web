<strong>I am Ksenia</strong>, a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> in the machine learning group of <a href=
https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/">Nando de Freitas</a>. 
In my research I am interested in generalisation and adaptation to multiple tasks in offline reinforcement learning. These questions inspire me because they bring a promise to solve many real-world problems.

      <div class="col-md-8 justified">
        <p>
I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/">EPFL</a>'s <a href="http://cvlab.epfl.ch/">CVLab</a> in January 2019, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en">Pascal Fua</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sznitr/">Raphael Sznitman</a>. 
In autumn 2017 during my internship at Google Research in Zurich I had a chance to work with <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/105461.html">Vittorio Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/JasperUijlings.html">Jasper Uijlings</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Algorithms and Machine Learning from <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en">University of Helsinki</a>.
During that time, I also worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.hiit.fi/complex-systems-computation">CoSCo</a> group at <a href="https://www.hiit.fi/">HIIT</a>.
Before, I studied in Russia at the <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/">Higher School of Economics</a> in the faculty of Business Informatics and Applied Mathematics.

At DeepMind I work on offline reinforcement learning and reward learning. 
In particular, I am interested in generalisation and adaptation to various tasks in multi-task, few-shot and zero-shot learning. 
Often, my research is motivated by the challenges in data-driven robotics.
During my PhD I worked on active learning for different classification tasks with more focus on vision applications. 
I developed a meta-learning approach to active learning, where a strategy is learnt from the previously encountered problems.
